# Multi-threaded Chat Application Using Java Sockets

This project is a functional chat application that allows multiple clients to communicate with a server in real-time. Built using Java sockets and multithreading, the application supports simultaneous connections from multiple users, enabling them to send and receive messages in a shared chat environment.

### Features:
- **Server and Client Communication**: The server listens for incoming client connections on a specified port. Once connected, clients can send and receive messages in real time.
- **Multithreading**: Each client is handled by a separate thread, allowing multiple clients to interact with the server simultaneously without blocking each other. This ensures that each client can send and receive messages independently.
- **Real-time Chat**: Clients can send messages to all connected clients, making it a group chat environment. The server forwards messages to all active clients.
- **User Interface**: Clients have a simple text-based interface where they can enter messages and view incoming messages from other clients.

### How It Works:
1. **Server**: The server listens for client connections on a specified port. Upon connection, it creates a new thread for each client to handle communication with that client individually.
2. **Clients**: Clients connect to the server using the serverâ€™s IP address and port number. They can send messages to the server, which then broadcasts the message to all other connected clients.
3. **Multithreading**: Each client is managed by its own thread on the server, ensuring that one client's message does not block others from sending or receiving messages.
4. **Real-time Communication**: Once connected, clients can send messages in real-time, and these messages are broadcast to all other connected clients via the server.

### Instructions:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chat-application.git
   ```
2. **Run the Server**:
   - Compile and run the server using the following commands:
     ```
     javac Server.java
     java Server
     ```
3. **Run the Clients**:
   - Compile and run the client(s) using the following commands:
     ```
     javac Client.java
     java Client
     ```
   - Clients must enter the server's IP address and port number to connect.

### Example Output:
Clients will be able to see messages from other clients in the chat window, for example:
```
Client 1: Hello, everyone!
Client 2: Hi there! How are you?
Client 1: I'm doing great, thanks!
```
